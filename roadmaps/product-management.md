# Product Management Roadmap
Imagine you're in charge of building a really cool new playground. You don’t make the swings or slides yourself, but you decide what the playground should have so kids have the best time.  
First, you talk to the kids (the users) to learn what they want—maybe swings, monkey bars, or a slide that twists! Then, you check with the grown-ups (the business) to make sure the playground fits the budget and rules.  
Next, you work with builders (the engineers and designers) to make the playground real. You draw a plan and guide them on where to put each piece. If the monkey bars are too high, you help fix it so everyone’s happy and safe.  
Finally, when the playground is ready, you watch how the kids play. If they don't like something or have new ideas, you tweak it to make it even better.  
So, a Product Manager is like a big-picture guide. They listen, plan, and make sure everything works together so the "playground" (product) is awesome for everyone.
