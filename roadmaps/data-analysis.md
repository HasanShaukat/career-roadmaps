# Data Analyst Roadmap
A data analyst is like a detective for numbers. Imagine you have a big pile of LEGO pieces, and you’re trying to build something cool, but you don’t know what yet. The data analyst’s job is to sort through all those pieces, find patterns, and figure out how to put them together to make something amazing.  
They use a computer to look at numbers, pictures, or words and find hidden clues, like a treasure map. For example, if you own a lemonade stand, a data analyst could tell you which days people buy the most lemonade or what flavor they like best. They do this by looking at information (called "data") and making charts or graphs to show what it means.  
In the end, the data analyst helps people make better decisions. It’s like helping your parents figure out what to cook for dinner by telling them everyone’s favorite food. They make everything easier to understand so that others can solve problems or make things better!
