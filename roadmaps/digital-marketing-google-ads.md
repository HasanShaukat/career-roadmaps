# Digital Marketing (Google Ads) Roadmap
Imagine you have a lemonade stand, and you want more people to come and buy your lemonade. Google Ads is like putting up a magical sign on the busiest street in town, but instead of being a regular sign, it only shows up when people are looking for lemonade or drinks.  
Here’s how it works: People go to Google (like a big question-asking machine) and type, “Where can I get yummy lemonade?” If you’ve made a Google Ad, your lemonade stand pops up at the top of their screen, saying, “Hey! Come try my lemonade!”  
You pay a tiny bit of money to Google every time someone clicks on your magical sign to learn more about your lemonade. But don’t worry, you only pay when someone actually looks at your stand, not just for having the sign there.  
Google Ads lets you choose who sees your sign—maybe people in your neighborhood, or only those who love lemonade. It’s super smart! This way, you can tell the right people about your lemonade and get lots of customers without wasting money.
